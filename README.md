# kit: Kernel Improved Toolkit

Some things related to the Linux kernel dev process tooling. For context see:

* [Defragmenting the kernel development process](https://lwn.net/Articles/799134/)
* [Reflections on kernel development process, quality and testing](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/554/attachments/353/584/Reflections__Kernel_Summit_2019.pdf)
* Also these discussions on mailing lists:
  * [Reflections on kernel development processes](https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit-discuss/20190912120602.GC29277@pure.paranoia.local/)
  * [Reflections on kernel development processes (2)](https://lore.kernel.org/workflows/d6e8f49e93ece6f208e806ece2aa85b4971f3d17.1569152718.git.dvyukov@google.com/)
  * [Kernel development collaboration platform wish list](https://lore.kernel.org/workflows/1811089.yxvLMk49Ug@kreacher/)
  * [thoughts on a Merge Request based development workflow](https://lore.kernel.org/workflows/20190925104937.GA31002@hmswarspite.think-freely.org/T/#t)

Why is this on my private github? \
It was just easier to put an initial version here. If there is a better shared place, I am happy to move this.
